# IMSA-Room-Builder
A helpful tool for designing the perfect IMSA room furniture layout.
To use this, drag the furniture around with the mouse. Right click to rotate furniture. Flip the room vertically with the f key. Don't get anything in the red box, or that's a tier violation! (Not necessarily, but the red line represents a foot away from the PTAC).
